## Description

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
## Installation and Use

Clone or Fork this Repo to your local device. From the Root Directory, Git Bash npm i to download all required dependencies, then initiate the DB with 'mysql -u root -p'. Once complete type 'source db/schema.sql' to create the table(s) then exit the sql command line and type 'npm run seed'. This will seed the data to your table(s). After that, 'npm start' should start the server.
